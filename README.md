- Utilizing the `<picture>` element with `media` queries for **responsive images**.
- Designing reusable themes with `:root` and **CSS custom properties (variables)**.
- Writing **adaptive padding and gap** using `clamp()` to improve readability across screen sizes.
- Controlling overflow and layout with `min()` and `box-sizing`.
- Applying hover states and visual feedback for buttons.
- Centering layouts vertically and horizontally with `min-height: 100vh`.
